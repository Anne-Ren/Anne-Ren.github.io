## About Me

<img src="images/anne.jpg" class="floatpic" width="360" height="680">

Here is <font color="#9370DB">Xiuzi Ren (Anne, [任秀子]</font>).

I am a second-year academic master's degree student at Northwest A&F University, supervised by [Prof. Xuexuan Xu](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Xu-Xuexuan). My master's research involves <font color="#9370DB">soil conservation</font>,<font color="#9370DB">soil science</font>,<font color="#9370DB">soil water</font>,<font color="#82318E">extreme climate change</font> and <font color="#82318E">land use change analysis</font>. I prefer to seek PhD opportunity after my Master study.

Due to the gradual contact with the direction of <font color="#82318E">ecology</font>, I learned about other aspects, such as <font color="#82318E">soil carbon analysis</font>, and completed a bachelor's degree in grass science at Northwest A&F University under the guidance of  [Prof. Liang Guo](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Liang-Guo-26).

I am looking for PhD to start in <font color="#82318E">2024</font> Fall. Contact me if you have any leads!

## Research Interest

- Understanding of future dynamic land carbon sinks based on natural climate change and appropriate ecosystem management.
- Protect desertification and sandy land by optimizing ecosystem services such as water conservation and soil conservation.
- Long-term responses of ecosystem services such as soil conservation and carbon storage to extreme climates.

My current research focuses on The Effect of Fire on Soil Water Infiltration in Grassland in the Loess Plateau Area. My interest is the direction of soil science in the <font color="#82318E">management of agricultural ecosystems</font> in the future and the adjustment of <font color="#82318E">climate change</font>. In a word, for the future global ecosystems to change in a better direction, I wish to devote my talent to this meaningful cause and bring well-being to society.
