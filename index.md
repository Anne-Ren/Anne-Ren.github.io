## About Me

<br>

Hi,thereüëã.Welcome to <font color="#B509AC">Xiuzi Ren (Anne, ‰ªªÁßÄÂ≠ê)</font> Page.I'm a second-year academic master's degree student at Northwest A&F University, supervised by [Prof. Xuexuan Xu](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Xu-Xuexuan). My master's research involves <font color="#B509AC">soil conservation</font>,<font color="#B509AC">soil science</font>,<font color="#B509AC">soil water</font>,<font color="#B509AC">extreme climate change</font> and <font color="#B509AC">land use change analysis</font>. I prefer to seek PhD opportunity after my Master study.

<br>

Due to the gradual contact with the direction of <font color="#B509AC">ecology</font>, I learned about other aspects, such as <font color="#B509AC">soil carbon analysis</font>, and completed a bachelor's degree in grass science at Northwest A&F University under the guidance of  [Prof. Liang Guo](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Liang-Guo-26).

<br>

I am looking for PhD to start in <font color="#B509AC">2024</font> Fall. Contact me if you have any leads!

## Research Interest

- Understanding of future dynamic land carbon sinks based on natural climate change and appropriate ecosystem management.
- Protect desertification and sandy land by optimizing ecosystem services such as water conservation and soil conservation.
- Long-term responses of ecosystem services such as soil conservation and carbon storage to extreme climates.

My current research focuses on The <font color="#B509AC"> Effect of Fire on Soil Water Infiltration in Grassland in the Loess Plateau Area</font>. My interest is the direction of soil science in the <font color="#B509AC">management of agricultural ecosystems</font> in the future and the adjustment of <font color="#B509AC">climate change</font>. In a word, for the future global ecosystems to change in a better direction, I wish to devote my talent to this meaningful cause and bring well-being to society.
