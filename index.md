## About Me

<br>

Hi,thereüëã.Welcome to <font color="#B509AC">Xiuzi Ren (Anne, ‰ªªÁßÄÂ≠ê)</font> Page.I'm a second-year academic master's degree student at Northwest A&F University, supervised by [Prof. Xuexuan Xu](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Xu-Xuexuan). My master's research involves <font color="#B509AC">soil conservation</font>,<font color="#B509AC">soil science</font>,<font color="#B509AC">soil water</font>,<font color="#B509AC">extreme climate change</font> and <font color="#B509AC">land use change analysis</font>. I prefer to seek PhD opportunity after my Master study.

<br>

Due to the gradual contact with the direction of <font color="#B509AC">ecology</font>, I learned about other aspects, such as <font color="#B509AC">soil carbon analysis</font>, and completed a bachelor's degree in grass science at Northwest A&F University under the guidance of  [Prof. Liang Guo](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Liang-Guo-26).

<br>

I am looking for PhD to start in <font color="#B509AC">2024</font> Fall. Here is [my CV](https://caihanlin.com/file/CV-HanlinCAI.pdf).
