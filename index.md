## About Me



<br>

Hi,thereüëã.Welcome to Xiuzi Ren (Anne, ‰ªªÁßÄÂ≠ê) Page.I'm a second-year academic master's degree student at Northwest A&F University, supervised by [<font color="#B509AC">Prof. Xuexuan Xu</font>](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Xu-Xuexuan). My master's research involves soil conservation,soil science,soil water,extreme climate change and land use change analysis. I prefer to seek PhD opportunity after my Master study.

<br>

Due to the gradual contact with the direction of ecology, I learned about other aspects, such as soil carbon analysis, and completed a bachelor's degree in grass science at Northwest A&F University under the guidance of [<font color="#B509AC">Prof. Liang Guo</font>](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Liang-Guo-26).

<br>

I am looking for PhD to start in 2024 Fall. Here is [<font color="#B509AC">my CV</font>](https://Anne-Ren.github.io/mypaper/AnneCV.pdf).

## Undergraduate Thesis



- This study selected different abandonment years grasslands in the Wangdonggou small watershed of Changwu County, Shaanxi Province, in the central southern region of the Loess Plateau as the research object. Through field simulation fire experiments, this research offers a fresh perspective on stating the effect of fire on soil moisture infiltration behaviors. To determine the optimal abandonment year in the region, measuring the grassland soil basic properties with different abandonment years and analyzing their differences were used. The findings should make an contribution to the restoration of the ecological system in the Loess Hilly Area. Sampling of soil after burning is currently underway.
